                is a kekkei genkai
                dōjutsu that originated from the Ōtsutsuki clan. After the Ōtsutsuki settled on Earth, the Byakugan
                became more commonly associated with the Hyūga clan, descendants of the Ōtsutsuki. It is regarded as
                one of the "Three Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Sharingan and the Rinnegan.</th>

                featureless in appearance with a barely visible pupil. When depicted in the anime, the dōjutsu is
                light blue in colour with a darkened sclera and visible pupil.</th>

                who will calm the world or a "God of Destruction" who will reduce everything to nothingness. The
