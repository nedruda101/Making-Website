<h2><center>ADVENTURE TIME TRIBUTE</center></h2>
<p>
True to form, the finale gave us an ending that was really a beginning. Adventure Time has always emphasized a Buddhist-style philosophy of endless renewal; death leads to rebirth, chaos to order, to chaos again, again, and again.<br>
After a full decade of mind-expanding shenanigans, Adventure Time has finally come to an end.<br> What a long, strange journey itâ€™s been.

The winding path led us from small-scale whimsy to intergalactic adventure, building up dense layers of mythology, making for hours worth of wiki-reading. What kind of ending could possibly conclude such a twisted, tendrilled tale?<br>
It is sad that it's ending but all good things come to an end so,<br><br><br><br>
<i><b><center>Come along with me<br>
And the butterflies and bees<br>
We can wander through the forest<br>
And do so as we please<br>
Come along with me<br>
To a cliff under a tree<br>
Where we can gaze upon the water<br>
As an everlasting dream<br>
All of my collections<br>
I'll share them all with you<br>
Maybe by next summer<br>
We won't have changed our tunes<br>
I still want to be<br>
With the butterflies and bees<br>
Making up new numbers<br>
And living so merrily<br>
All of my collections<br>
I'll share them all with you<br>
I'll be here for you always<br>
And always be with you<br>
Come along with me<br>
And the butterflies and bees<br>
We can wander through the forest<br>
And do so as we please<br>
Living so merrily</i></center></b>
