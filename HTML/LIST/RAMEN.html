    <li>Rinse the chicken bones in cold water, then place them in a large pot with the water, pork, garlic, ginger, and
      green onions.</li><br>

    <li>Add the soy sauce, sake, and <i>mirin</i>, then leave to simmer with the pot covered until ready to serve.</li><br>
    <li>Mix the ingredients for the <i>chashu</i> sauce in a large pan. Add the pork, then bring to the boil over a
      medium
      heat. Cover with a lid, leaving slightly open so the steam can escape, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for
      around 30 minutes, turning the meat from time to time until just a little bit of liquid is left.</li><br>
    <li>Remove the lid, stay with the pan, and watch the liquid simmer until bubbles start to appear.</li><br>
    <li>Turn the pork to cover it completely with the sauce, then remove from the pan and slice thinly.</li><br>
    <li>When ready to serve, cook the ramen following the instructions on the packaging. Divide the broth into six
      bowls, then add the noodles, pork, bamboo shoots, soy-marinated eggs, and green onions.</li><br>
    <li>SERVE HOT</li><br>
  </ol>



  <h2>History</h2>
  <img src="list2.png" alt="Image of Ramen"
    style="float:right;clear: right;margin-right: 10px;margin-bottom:10px;margin-top: 0px;border: transparent;padding: 4px;width: 350px;" />
  <!--https://animerecipes.tumblr.com-->
  <!--https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Ramen_Ichiraku-->
  <p style="margin-left: 10px;margin-right:10px">Ramen Ichiraku was founded by Teuchi thirty-four years before the start
    of Part II. Although it is quite small and
    has an unassuming appearance, Ramen Ichiraku has always been popular with Konoha's villagers because of Teuchi's
    strong commitment to taste, giving the ramen an almost artistic quality. Like any ramen establishment, Ramen
    Ichiraku offers various toppings, such as char siu and boiled eggs. In Konoha Hiden, seaweed had been the most
    popular topping for several years until, after the Fourth Shinobi World War, it was surpassed by naruto.<br><br>

    Ramen Ichiraku is Naruto Uzumaki's favourite dining establishment. He eats there regularly – usually stopping by
    between missions – and he is often joined by Iruka Umino, another frequent customer. Because Naruto has been a loyal
    customer for most of his life, Teuchi and his daughter, Ayame, were among the few people in Konoha not to treat
    Naruto with animosity during his youth. Naruto takes Hinata Hyūga to Ramen Ichiraku for their first date; in the
    anime, this in turn causes Hinata to become a regular customer, to the point that she has won at least one of its
    eating contests. In Konoha Hiden, Teuchi gives Naruto a lifetime pass for Ramen Ichiraku as a wedding present, which
    the anime shows to have received heavy use over the following years.<br><br>
    

    The original Ramen Ichiraku is destroyed along with the rest of Konoha during Pain's Assault. In the anime, Inari is
    implied to have been responsible for rebuilding it, as a favour to Naruto. As Naruto becomes increasingly famous,
    first as a war hero and later as Hokage, Ramen Ichiraku prospers; in Konoha Hiden, this is explained to be because
    of customers' hopes of either seeing Naruto there or simply a desire to emulate him and his successes. The second
    Ramen Ichiraku is ill-suited for this increased business, so it is remodeled and expanded into an indoor restaurant
    at some point after Ayame takes over management. Ayame even makes Naruto their official promoter; in one such
    advertisement, he claims that Ramen Ichiraku is just as nutritious as soldier pills.<br><br>

    In addition to the fresh-made ramen that it is known for, Ramen Ichiraku has at times dabbled in other products. In
    one episode of the anime, Teuchi starts making diet ramen to help Ayame lose weight, which ends up becoming popular
    with female patrons. In another episode, Ayame convinces her father to serve tsukemen instead of ramen. Naruto
    disapproves of this, and by the next time he is seen visiting it is back to serving ramen. At some point, Ramen
    Ichiraku starts selling instant ramen, empty cups of which tend to litter Naruto's desk at work.</p><br>
  <h2>Trivia</h2>
  <ul style="margin-bottom: 50px;">
    <li>There is a real-life ramen restaurant, also called Ichiraku Ramen, in Fukuoka, Japan, near where locals say
      Masashi Kishimoto went to university (Kyushu Sangyo Daigaku). The restaurant has two locations: one near JR's
      Kyu-dai Mae station, very close to the university, and a second in the downtown Hakata area. The restaurants sell
      handkerchiefs emblazoned with various Naruto characters that come in noodle cups labelled "Ichiraku Ramen".</li><br>
    <li>In the manga, Teuchi hires Matsu and Nishi to help him around the shop while Ayame is on a vacation. Both are
      fairly inept, either accidentally sticking their fingers in the ramen or spilling bowls on themselves.</li><br>
    <li>In <i>Naruto Shippūden the Movie: The Lost Tower</i>, Naruto travels twenty-three years into the past and
      witnesses Ramen Ichiraku's grand opening, a contradiction of the manga.</li><br>
    <li>In Ramen Ichiraku's eating contest, Hinata Uzumaki holds the record of forty-six servings in one sitting,
      earning her the nickname "Queen of Gluttony". Chōji Akimichi holds the record for second place with forty-two
      servings, followed by his father, Chōza, with at least eighteen servings. The top three records have an instant
      photo of the winner and their record of servings written on it, posted behind the cash register.</li><br>
