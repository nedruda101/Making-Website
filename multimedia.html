    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>In a cabin in Wall Rose, the top ten and Armin are surprised by their inclusion into Squad Levi. Eren is made to
        run some tests in Titan form, but fails to harden his body. Hange brings news of Pastor Nick's death at the
        hands of the interior MP's. The Scouts then flee to Trost after hearing from Erwin.

        The government is opposing the Scout Regiment, demanding custody of Eren and Historia. Levi runs a decoy
        strategy so Jean and Armin are abducted instead of the targets. Mikasa subdues the kidnappers as Levi watches
        Eren's hearse. While looking on, Levi is ambushed by an old adversary and his team.</p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>At an unknown time, Eren Jaeger looks out over the sea as gulls fly overhead. His hair has grown long and shaggy,
        and he reflects on how, though Armin Arlelt always told him there was a sea beyond the Walls, he has always
        wondered what was beyond it.</p>
    <div class="image1">

    </div>

    <p>In the present day, Eren and the remaining members of the 104th Cadet Corps settle into a remote rural cabin.
        They bicker over cleaning, Sasha Braus stealing food, and Mikasa Ackermann working out so soon after having been
        grabbed by a Titan. It reminds them of their time together in the Cadet Corps, but times have changed. The group
        of them have been organized into the new Levi Squad to protect</p>
    <br><br>
    <h4>Eren and Historia Reiss.</h4>
    <p>As the group confronts Sasha to get her to put back the stolen bread, Levi arrives and swipes his hand underneath
        the table, revealing the dirt beneath. He notes with disappointment that they should have had enough time to
        clean, but postpones that discussion for later, instead taking the squad out to work on Hange Zoë's experiment
        regarding Eren's powers.
    </p>

    <p>The experiment goes poorly, with Eren exhibiting increasingly less control over his transformations, to the point
        his Titan no longer appears at its full size and has lost significant muscle mass. Additionally, most of Eren's
        body is hanging out the back of the nape.
    </p>
    <div class="image2">
        <img src="hange.webp" alt="hange Shenanigans">
    </div>

    <p>When he does not respond to Hange's shouts, Mikasa jumps off her horse and runs up to him with her blades drawn.
        Hange also comes down to Eren and tries pulling his body from his Titan. Eren's face has withered away to
        Hange's excitement and they ask Moblit Berner to make a sketch. Mikasa cuts him free though, giving Hange
        another look at him, and Hange apologizes, realizing that they had gotten carried away.</p>
    <p>Seeing Eren in this state, the Scouts conclude that they are a long way from using his hardening ability to seal
        Wall Maria. Hange announces that the experiment is done and Keiji informs the Scouts to make sure there are no
        witnesses. However, in the distance, two people are watching the smoke from Eren's transformation.
    </p>
    <p>That evening in Trost District, Erwin Smith reads the report Levi has brought regarding Hange's failed
        experiment. Levi believes the problem is that they lack information about the hardening ability. He wonders if
        they could get the information they need through Historia. Erwin says he looked into her background and she is
        the illegitimate daughter of Lord Reiss, and muses on why a regional lord like him would know the secrets of the
        Wall.</p>
    <div class="image1">
        <img src="conny.webp" alt="conny Shenanigans">
    </div>
    <p>After sleeping for a full day, Eren comes into the kitchen of the cabin to help his fellow squad members prepare
        food. He is disappointed that the plan to repair the Wall has been shelved because of him. Conny Springer admits
        that all he cares about now is getting a chance to fight the Beast Titan. Realizing that he is getting caught up
        in his anger and the memory of his mother being transformed into a Titan, Conny says it is about time to change
        the lookouts and he and Mikasa go to relieve Jean and Sasha, leaving Eren and Historia alone.</p>
    <p>Historia comments that it is nice that Eren and the others have goals, even if they are not easy ones. Now that
        Ymir is gone she no longer knows what she wants. At first, she wanted to save her, but then she realized that
        Ymir leaving was her own choice, and she has no right to change that. Eren is glad that Historia has started
        speaking again, but she apologizes that the good-girl Christa that everyone knew no longer exists. However, Eren
        admits that he never liked her previous self, because it felt forced and unnatural. Now she is like a normal,
        honest girl. As he also remembers Ymir, a memory of her and Bertholdt Hoover comes back to him.

        Eren and Historia are called to join everyone else, and Hange informs them of the death of Pastor Nick. He was
        tortured and then killed earlier this morning in the Trost District barracks by the First Interior Squad of the
        Military Police Regiment, a group that normally operates in the capital. Hange was not able to get more than a
        glimpse of the body, but it was enough to see that all his fingernails had been torn out. From this Levi is able
        to conclude that Nick had not talked before being killed, which means the Military Police does not know the
        Scouts are looking into the Reiss family.</p>
    <div class="image2">
        <td><img src="nifa.webp" alt="nifa Shenanigans"></td>
    </div>
    <p>Nifa arrives with a message from Erwin. On reading it, Levi orders everyone to move out, and to leave no trace
        that they were here. By sunset, the cabin is swarmed by Military Police, but Levi and Hange's squads are already
        outside in the woods. Levi reveals that the government has ceased all Scout activity outside of the Wall and
        demanded that Eren and Historia be handed over. Nifa adds that after she received the message from Erwin, the
        Military Police came to arrest him.</p>
    <p>Levi decides to take everyone to Trost District, because it would be safer than the interior and they can use
        omni-directional mobility gear in the city. Hange decides that they and Moblit will go after Erwin, but leaves
        Abel, Keiji, and Nifa behind to assist Levi. Before climbing on their horse, Eren hands Hange a note covering
        the conversation he remembered between Ymir and Bertholdt.</p>
    <p>The next day in Trost District, Conny notices that the royal family's flag is hanging everywhere due to the
        anniversary of the King's coronation. The Military Police takes the opportunity to distribute rations from the
        royal family's reserves to the population of Trost and build public favor of the King. Levi notes that this is a
        calculated move by the King and his court. Lord Reiss tells the other advisors assembled that the more important
        thing for them is to obtain the power and the vessel. They already have a plan in motion.</p>
    <div class="image1">
        <td><img src="mikasa.webp" alt="mikasa Shenanigans"></td>
    </div>
    <p>Meanwhile, Levi Squad makes their way through Trost when a wagon appears out of nowhere, barreling towards the
        Scouts. The people inside grab what appear to be Eren and Historia, but they are really Jean Kirschtein and
        Armin in disguise, while Eren and Historia are being transported in a different, enclosed wagon by Keiji. Levi
        and his squad chase after the kidnappers. Due to one of them molesting Armin, Mikasa warns Levi that their
        disguises are not going to last. Noting that the kidnappers appear to be amateurs, he leaves the situation in
        his squad's hands while he goes to Eren.</p>
    <p>As the lead kidnapper and his henchmen enter the warehouse where Jean and Armin are being held, they notice the
        guard is missing. Mikasa and the rest of the squad, including Jean and Armin, attack the remaining kidnappers.
        The kidnappers are quickly restrained and Mikasa informs the rest of the squad that after tying them up they are
        to meet with Levi.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere, Levi joins Nifa on a rooftop where they have a good view of Keiji's journey through the city with Eren
        and Historia. However, even though the body double decoy was a success, Levi realizes that using such amateurs
        does not feel like a Military Police operation. He asks Nifa if she has heard of Kenny the Ripper and assures
        her that the legendary mass murderer is a real person. Levi grew up with him, and this operation feels like
        something Kenny would do.</p>
        <div class="image2">
            <td><img src="levikenny.webp" alt="levi Shenanigans"></td>
        </div>
        
   <p id="magic"> He realizes too late, that in Kenny's place, he would have two groups tailing the wagon from the rear, from a high
    place with a view, just like where they are now. Levi tries to warn Nifa, but is too late as a man blows off part of
    her head using ODM that has been modified to carry a shotgun instead of a blade. More soldiers appear, of a unit
    that has not been seen before, and one of them kills Abel. The mysterious man taunts Levi, claiming that he hasn't
    change much at all, as he stalks up the rooftop and reloads his guns, and Levi screams as he draws his blades to
    retaliate: the man is Kenny himself.
